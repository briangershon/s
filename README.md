# s

A smart 'status' that supports git, mercurial or subversion repository.

Just type `s` in any git, mercurial or svn repo to get its status.

## How to setup

- clone this repo

- add symlink somewhere in your path (`cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s ~/s/s.sh s`)

- now `s` is available everywhere on your system
